                Two-factor authentication adds a second authentication factor, other then your password, to your
                account. This makes your account more secure against people guessing your password or using your
                computer with a password manager open. You will need to use this second authentication factor
                whenever you sign in to the website.
            </p>

            <p class="card-text">
                You can use any two-factor authentication app with Proto. Good recommendations are Google
                Authenticator or Authy. Look for them in your device's app store.
