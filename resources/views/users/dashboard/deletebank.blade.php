                    This action will cancel your current automatic withdrawal authorization. Everything bought
                    up until now will still be withdrawn from this bank account, but no more purchases can be
                    made using this authorization.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After all outstanding balance with this authorization has been paid, the authorization will
                    be permanently deleted. If you wish to make purchases in the future, you can always add a
                    new authorization.
