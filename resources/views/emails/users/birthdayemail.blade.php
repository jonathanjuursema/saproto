        Hi {{ $user->calling_name }},
    </p>

    <p>
        Happy birthday! Because we are so excited it is the day you were born, you can get a free cookie! Just hop by the Protopolis and ask a board member for your birthday cookie and we will be glad to help you out.
    </p>

        Have a great day,
        Board {{ config('proto.boardnumber') }}
