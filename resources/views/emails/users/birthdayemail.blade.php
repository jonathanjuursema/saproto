        Hey {{ $user->calling_name }},
    </p>

    <p>
        We are writing you to congratulate you with your birthday! Because of the coronavirus, we cannot give you the
        customary birthday cookie in Protopolis or the birthday pull at a Proto Drink. However, if we are able to do a
        Proto Drink before the summer holidays, we would like to invite you to stop by and collect your free birthday
        drink (one beer or one soda). We hope you have a great day!
    </p>

    <p>
        Kind regards,
        Board {{ config('proto.boardnumber') }}
    </p>
