## Contributors

[Here](https://github.com/saproto/saproto/graphs/contributors) you can find the people that have contributed to the code to this project. But, let's not forget the other members of the [HYTTIOAOAc](https://www.proto.utwente.nl/committee/haveyoutriedturningitoffandonagain)!

## Prerequisites

This README is tailored to using Docker in WSL2 (Ubuntu) on Windows using Laravel Sail. Laravel Sail also supports MacOS and Linux, however you may encounter issues with the installation instruction below when using a different operating system.

Before following the installation instructions, you need to have a working installation of WSL2, Docker and Git. You can install docker using the official instructions at [docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker). JetBrains [PhpStorm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/installation-guide.html) is strongly recommended for development on this project, especially with the laravel plugin for proper code completion and reverences.

## Setup
This website can be run locally through Docker by using Laravel Sail. For more information on using Laravel Sail check out their [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/sail).

### Download
First you need to clone the repository into a folder in WSL2.

#### If you set an SSH key:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:saproto/saproto.git
```

#### Otherwise, use HTTPS:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/saproto/saproto.git
```

### Installation
After installing Docker and cloning the repository the following instructions can be run in the terminal in the source folder of the project.

#### Configuration
Copy and rename `.env.sail.example` to `.env`.

```shell
cp .env.sail.example .env
```

After that, open the new `.env` file and set the `PERSONAL_PROTO_KEY` to your personal Proto key, which can be found/generated on the bottom of [your dashboard](https://www.proto.utwente.nl/user/dashboard) on the ***live*** Proto website.

#### Server-side dependencies
When first cloning the project you may not have a functional installation of the correct version of PHP or Composer. To install Laravel sail and its dependencies it is therefore necessary to spin up a temporary container.

```shell
docker run --rm \
    -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    -v $(pwd):/var/www/html \
    -w /var/www/html \
    laravelsail/php81-composer:latest \
    composer install --ignore-platform-reqs --no-scripts
```

#### Laravel Sail alias
By default, Laravel Sail commands are invoked using the `vendor/bin/sail` script. That is a lot of characters to type every time you want to execute a command. So, instead you can create an alias. By adding the alias definition to `~/.bash_aliases` the alias will persist between terminal restarts. 

*The rest of these instruction will assume that you successfully added the `sail` alias.*

```shell
echo "alias sail='[ -f sail ] && bash sail || bash vendor/bin/sail'" > ~/.bash_aliases
```

#### Initial application setup
```shell
sail up -d
sail composer install
sail artisan key:generate
sail artisan migrate --seed
```

#### Client-side dependencies
To install the client-side dependencies you'll need to run `sail npm install` to install all client-side dependencies.

To compile the project assets (JS/CSS) run `sail npm run dev` to compile once or `sail npm run watch` to keep checking for changes to scripts or stylesheets.

When adding a new library or client-side dependency through npm don't forget to require the scripts in `application.js` and the stylesheet in `vendor.scss`.

#### Localhost
When you have finished the above setup the following port will be exposed on localhost.

- `80` = Website
- `8081` = PhpMyAdmin
- `8082` = [Mailhog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog)

You can sign in with the same Proto username you use on the ***live*** website and the password given to you during the database seeding. This user will have full admin rights on the ***local*** website.

#### Known WSL2 + Git issue
Due to the permission changes, Git might detect that all files have been changed. If this is the case, run `git config core.filemode false` to make git ignore the permission changes.

### Useful commands

#### Start server
```shell
sail up -d
```

#### Stop server
```shell
sail stop
```

#### Access to app container
```shell
sail shell
```

#### Nuke your database *(run in container)*
```shell
sail artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

### Code completion, style and static analysis
##### IDE-helper
When writing code it is useful to have tools such as code completion and linting in an integrated development environment (IDE). As mentioned before [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) is the recommended IDE for this project. To add additional code completion for Laravel you can run `sail composer ide-helper` in the docker container to let [Laravel-IDE-Helper](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper) generate an `_ide_helper.php` file which tells PHPStorm what certain classes and function are, so it can perform proper code completion and show documentation.

##### PHP-CS-Fixer
Run `sail composer fix` in the docker container to fix stylistic errors in your code using [PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer). This will also be done automatically when creating a pull-request or pushing to a branch with an open pull-request.

##### Larastan
There is also the option for static analysis of your code. Run `sail composer analyse` in the docker container to let [Larastan](https://github.com/nunomaduro/larastan) find any potential bugs in your code. 

## Debugging
### Xdebug
Xdebug is activated in Laravel Sail to aid you while debugging the website. Xdebug enables breakpoints and step debugging which can easily be controlled from your IDE. For this to work, you will have to set up your IDE correctly.

#### Xdebug in PhpStorm
PhpStorm  for zero-configuration debugging. In case of zero-configuration debugging, you do not need to create any debug configuration. Instead, you open the starting page of your PHP application in the browser manually, and then activate the debugging engine from the browser, while PhpStorm listens to incoming debugger connections. For full instructions on how to use zero-configuration debugging, check out the [PhpStorm documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/zero-configuration-debugging.html)

### Clockwork
[Clockwork](https://underground.works/clockwork) is a php dev tool in your browser. When running the website in debug mode you can access the clockwork debug page at <localhost:8080/clockwork>. The application has various debugging features such as timelines of runtime requests, database queries and client-metrics.


## Testing
This project has some [Laravel Dusk](https://laravel.com/docs/dusk) based end-to-end tests. These tests use a headless browser which runs in the `selenium` docker container. The tests can be run with `sail dusk` and should show you if the parts of the application which are covered by the tests are still functioning as expected. You can run `sail dusk:fails` to safe some time by re-running failing tests first.

To start testing you will need to copy and rename `.env` to `.env.dusk`.

```shell
cp .env .env.dusk
```

Next set the `APP_URL` and `DB_DATABASE` fields in your new `.env.dusk` to `testing`.

Finally, run `sail artisan dusk:install` to install the default dusk chrome drivers.

> **⚠️IMPORTANT**  
> Whenever you try to change the behaviour of a feature covered by a test it is import to check if the test needs to be updated. This also goes for the front-end, as we use end-to-end tests which interact with elements on the page directly.
